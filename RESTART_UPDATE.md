# 🎮 GAME UPDATE - Restart on Detection

## ✅ NEW FEATURE: Instant Restart

**Getting detected now restarts the level automatically!**

---

## 🚨 What Happens When Detected

### Before (Old):
- Guard's cone turns red
- He chases you
- Game continues with you being chased

### Now (New):
**When fully detected (100% detection, red cone):**
1. 🚨 **Console shows: "DETECTED BY GUARD!"**
2. ⏱️ **2-second freeze** - You see what happened
3. 🔄 **Automatic restart** - Level resets
4. ✅ **Try again!** - Back to starting position

---

## 🎯 Detection Stages

### Stage 1: Safe 🟢
- **Green cone** = Guard hasn't noticed
- You can move freely

### Stage 2: Suspicious 🟡
- **Yellow cone** = Heard a sound or saw movement
- Guard is investigating
- **Not game over yet!** Hide quickly!

### Stage 3: DETECTED 🔴
- **Red cone** = Guard fully spotted you (100%)
- **GAME OVER** - Level restarts in 2 seconds
- Everything resets:
  - You return to start position
  - Guard returns to patrol
  - All detection levels reset

---

## 💡 Stealth Tips

### Avoid Detection:
1. **Watch the cone** - Green = safe, Yellow = danger, Red = restart!
2. **Stay out of vision** - Don't walk into green cones
3. **Don't run** - Makes noise (yellow cone)
4. **Hide if spotted** - Press E at brown boxes when cone turns yellow
5. **Use cover** - Stay behind platforms

### Recovery Tactics:
- **Yellow cone?** Hide immediately! (Press E near box)
- **Red cone?** Too late - level restarts
- **Learn from mistakes** - Watch where you got caught

---

## 🎮 The Challenge

**Can you reach the goal without EVER triggering a restart?**

### Difficulty Levels:
- **Easy**: Hide when yellow, avoid red
- **Medium**: Never let cone turn yellow
- **Hard**: Speed run without stopping
- **Impossible**: No hiding spots used

---

## 🔄 What Gets Reset

When the level restarts:
- ✅ Your position (back to x=-15)
- ✅ Guard position (back to x=5)
- ✅ Guard state (unaware, green cone)
- ✅ Detection level (0%)
- ✅ Hiding spots (all empty)
- ✅ Your facing direction (right)

---

## 🎯 New Strategy Required

### Old Strategy:
"Run around, hide when spotted, wait for chase to end"

### New Strategy (REQUIRED):
"Don't get spotted at all - getting caught = restart!"

This makes stealth **actually matter**. You MUST:
- Be patient
- Watch patrol patterns
- Time your movements
- Use hiding spots **before** detection reaches 100%

---

## 🕹️ Quick Test

Try this to see the restart in action:
1. **Start the game**
2. **Walk directly into the guard's green vision cone**
3. **Wait** - Watch detection fill (green → yellow → red)
4. **Boom!** - Level restarts after 2 seconds
5. **Try again** with a better strategy!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Preventing Restarts:
1. **Observe first** - Watch 2 full patrol cycles before moving
2. **Move when safe** - Only walk when cone faces away
3. **Use hiding spots early** - Don't wait until red
4. **Plan your route** - Know where boxes are
5. **Stay calm** - Panic = mistakes = detection = restart

### Yellow Cone Warning:
- You have ~1 second to hide before it turns red
- Sprint to nearest hiding spot (hold Shift + press E)
- Yellow cone doesn't restart the game (yet!)
